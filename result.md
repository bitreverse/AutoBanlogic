### Idealization
To analyze the protocol using Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, let's idealize the messages:

- **Message 1 Idealization** (I1): This message is an introduction of IDs and questions but not directly contributing to the belief about the secret key's application. Thus, its direct idealization might not contribute to achieving the goals initially established.
  
- **Message 2 Idealization** (I2): B → A: {Q<sub>A</sub>, Q<sub>B</sub>}<sub>K<sub>ab</sub></sub>
  
    Idealizes to B sending to A a combined message of Q<sub>A</sub> and Q<sub>B</sub> combined with K<sub>ab</sub>, symbolizing acknowledging and responding to A's challenge.
  
- **Message 3 Idealization** (I3): A → B: \<Q<sub>B</sub>, Q<sub>A</sub>><sub>K<sub>ab</sub></sub>
  
    Represents A sending back to B a confirmation response, flipped in order for verifiability.

### Assumptions (Provided)
As provided by the user, the entities A and B have shared assumptions about the key K<sub>ab</sub> and the freshness of their questions Q<sub>A</sub> and Q<sub>B</sub> respectively. These assumptions are re-stated for clarity:

- **(A1)** A believes A⇐<sup>K<sub>ab</sub></sup>⇒B
- **(A2)** A believes fresh(Q<sub>A</sub>)
- **(A3)** B believes A⇐<sup>K<sub>ab</sub></sup>⇒B
- **(A4)** B believes fresh(Q<sub>B</sub>)

### Derivation
Let's apply the BAN logic rules to derive the goals from the assumptions and idealized steps.

#### For Goal (G1): A believes B believes Q<sub>A</sub>, Q<sub>B</sub>

1. **(D1)** From I2, B uses K<sub>ab</sub> to encrypt Q<sub>A</sub> and Q<sub>B</sub>, sending them to A.

2. **(D2)** Apply the Message Meaning rule. Since A believes A⇐<sup>K<sub>ab</sub></sup>⇒B (A1), and A sees {Q<sub>A</sub>, Q<sub>B</sub>}<sub>K<sub>ab</sub></sub> (from D1), A believes B said Q<sub>A</sub>, Q<sub>B</sub>.

3. **(D3)** Apply the Freshness and Nonce Verification rules. Since A believes fresh(Q<sub>A</sub>) (A2), and A believes B said Q<sub>A</sub>, Q<sub>B</sub> (from D2), therefore A believes B believes Q<sub>A</sub>, Q<sub>B</sub>.

#### For Goal (G2): B believes A believes Q<sub>B</sub>, Q<sub>A</sub>

1. **(D4)** From I3, A uses K<sub>ab</sub> to encrypt the response with Q<sub>B</sub>, Q<sub>A</sub>, and sends it to B.

2. **(D5)** Apply the Message Meaning rule. Since B believes A⇐<sup>K<sub>ab</sub></sup>⇒B (A3), and B sees \<Q<sub>B</sub>, Q<sub>A</sub>><sub>K<sub>ab</sub></sub> (from D4), then B believes A said Q<sub>B</sub>, Q<sub>A</sub>.

3. **(D6)** Apply the Freshness and Nonce Verification rules. Since B believes fresh(Q<sub>B</sub>) (A4), and B believes A said Q<sub>B</sub>, Q<sub>A</sub> (from D5), therefore B believes A believes Q<sub>B</sub>, Q<sub>A</sub>.

### Conclusion
For both goals, **(G1)** and **(G2)**, the assumptions and the idealization steps provided, when analyzed under BAN logic rules, demonstrate that the protocol achieves mutual belief in the fresh knowledge of both A's and B's questions (or challenges), achieving the intended trust verification between A and B regarding their shared secrets within the scope of the assumptions made. 

This analysis shows that both A and B can be confident in the freshness and authenticity of their communication, thus verifying the security objectives regarding the shared secret information under the given BAN logic framework.
